Understanding the Context
In web debugging, especially in advanced scenarios, the primary goals are to identify and resolve issues that degrade server performance or cause errors under load. This often involves:

Performance Optimization: Tweaking server configurations to handle higher traffic loads efficiently.
Error Handling: Resolving issues that cause failed requests, timeouts, or unexpected server behaviors.
Resource Management: Ensuring optimal usage of server resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
Security Considerations: Addressing vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
