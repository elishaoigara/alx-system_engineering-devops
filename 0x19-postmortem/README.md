Postmortem Report: Web Application Downtime Due to Database Connection Failure
Issue Summary
Duration: March 4, 2025, 2:30 PM - March 4, 2025, 3:45 PM (UTC)
Impact:

The web application was completely inaccessible.
100% of users were affected.
API requests failed, preventing front-end and back-end services from retrieving data.
Root Cause: A misconfigured database connection string in the application server prevented authentication, causing repeated failures.
Timeline
2:30 PM – Monitoring system detected high API failure rates and sent alerts.
2:35 PM – Engineers confirmed the outage through logs and user reports.
2:40 PM – Initial investigation focused on network connectivity and server availability.
2:50 PM – Restarted the application server, but the issue persisted.
3:00 PM – Database logs reviewed, revealing repeated authentication failures.
3:15 PM – Identified incorrect database credentials in the environment variables.
3:30 PM – Updated the credentials and restarted the application.
3:45 PM – Service restored; all systems operational.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause
A recent update to the application environment variables mistakenly contained an incorrect database password. Since the database rejected all connection attempts, the application could not access or serve user data.

Resolution
The correct database credentials were retrieved from a secure backup. The environment variables were updated, and the application server was restarted, successfully restoring the service.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements
Strengthen configuration management to prevent incorrect updates.
Implement automated testing for environment variable changes before deployment.
Improve database monitoring to detect authentication failures earlier.
Actionable Tasks
 Add automated validation checks for configuration updates.
 Set up alerts for database authentication failures.
 Use a secrets management tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to store credentials securely.
 Document best practices for updating environment variables in the deployment process.
